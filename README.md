# Flunc Grammar

**Status:** *Experimental*

This project is an example of some grammar combinators constructed using the Isos and Prisms available in the [flunc-optics](https://github.com/flunc/optics) library. A grammar in this sense is something that combines the notion of both a parser and a printer in a single data type.

```
npm install flunc-grammar
```

The code used here is a translation of the Haskell Fresnel library created by Fraser Tweedale:
